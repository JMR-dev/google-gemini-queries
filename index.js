Covered Customers do not include a customer of the Company or an Affiliate who has fully and finally decided to cease doing business with the Company or the Affiliate due to no fault of Employee\u2019s or breach of this\n \nAgreement, and who have, in fact, ceased doing any business with the Company for at least 180 days immediately prior to Employee\u2019s Separation Date.\nC.\t\u201CConflicting Product or Service\u201D is a product and/or service that is the same or similar in function or purpose to a Company product and/or service, such that it would replace or compete with: a product and/or service the Company provides to its customers and regarding which Employee had business dealings or received Confidential Information during the Look Back Period; or a product or service that is under development or planning by the Company but not yet provided to customers and regarding which Employee was provided Confidential Information during the Look Back Period. Conflicting Products or Services do not include a product or service of the Company if the Company is no longer in the business of providing such product or service to its customers at the relevant time of enforcement.\nD.\t\u201CCompeting Activities\u201D are any activities or services undertaken on behalf of a Competing Business that are the same or similar in function or purpose to those Employee performed for the Company in the Look Back Period, or that are otherwise probable or likely to result in the use or disclosure of Confidential Information. Competing Activities are understood to exclude: activities on behalf of an independently operated subsidiary, division, or unit of a diversified corporation or similar business that has common ownership with a Competing Business so long as the independently operated business unit does not involve a Conflicting Product or Service; and, a passive and non-controlling ownership interest in a Competing Business through ownership of less than 2% of the stock in a publicly traded company.\nE.\t\u201CCompeting Business\u201D is any person or entity engaged in the business of providing a Conflicting Product or Service, including but not limited to, Allstate/SquareTrade (incl. iCracked), AmTrust/Warrantech, Assurant (incl.

Therefore, if Employee\u2019s responsibilities are sales or marketing, then the Restricted Area is the territory over which Employee had sales or marketing responsibilities during the Look Back Period. If Employee\u2019s responsibilities to the Company are nationwide in scope (such as, by way of example, Employee\u2019s executive, corporate, or administrative responsibilities), then the Geographic Area is the United States. Otherwise, the Geographic Area is understood to be the area within a 50 mile radius of the location(s) to which Employee reported or was assigned during the Look Back Period.\nG.\t\u201CLook Back Period\u201D is the two (2) year period preceding Employee\u2019s Separation\nDate.\n \n13.2\tRestriction on Interfering with Employee Relationships. Employee agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months following Employee\u2019s Separation Date, Employee will not interfere with the Company\u2019s business relationship with a Company employee, by: (a) soliciting or communicating with such an employee to induce or encourage them to leave the Company\u2019s employ (regardless of who first initiates the communication); (b) helping another person or entity evaluate a Company employee as an employment candidate; or (c) otherwise helping any person or entity hire an employee away from the Company; unless a duly authorized Company officer gives Employee written authorization to do so. Where required by state law, the foregoing restriction will only apply to employees with whom Employee had material business-related contact or about which Employee received Confidential Information, within the Look Back Period. This provision is limited to Company employees who were employed by the Company as of Employee\u2019s Separation Date, at any time during the ninety-day (90) period immediately following Employee\u2019s Separation Date, or within ninety (90) days preceding Employee\u2019s Separation Date.\n13.3\tRestriction on Interfering with Customer Relationships. Employee agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months after Employee\u2019s Separation Date, Employee will not interfere with the Company\u2019s business relationships with a Covered Customer by soliciting or communicating (regardless of who initiates the communication) with a Covered Customer to induce or encourage the Covered Customer to: (a) stop or reduce doing business with the Company or an Affiliate, or (b) to buy a Conflicting Product or Service; unless a duly authorized Company officer gives Employee written authorization to do so. The parties agree this restriction is inherently reasonable because it is limited to the places or locations where the Covered Customer is doing business at the time.\n13.4\tRestriction Against Unfair Competition. To the greatest extent permissible under the applicable state law, Employee agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months following Employee\u2019s Separation Date, Employee will not participate in, supervise, or manage (as an employee, consultant, contractor, officer, owner, director, or otherwise) Competing Activities in the Restricted Area. Employee further agrees that the consideration in Paragraph 2 above is bargained for and specifically includes consideration for the obligations in Paragraph 13.4.\n13.5\tSurvival of Restrictions. Employee will advise any future employer of the restrictions in this Agreement before accepting new employment. The post-employment restrictions provided for in this Agreement shall survive the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with the Company. If Employee fails to comply with a time-limited restriction in this Agreement, the time period applicable to the restriction shall be extended by one day for each day Employee is found to have violated the restriction up to a maximum period of twelve\n(12) calendar months.\n13.6\tState Specific Modifications. State-specific modifications of this Agreement, if any, are contained in Exhibit A.\n \n14.\tDefense of Claims. Employee agrees that for a period of two (2) years after Employee\u2019s Separation Date, upon request from the Company, Employee will cooperate with the Company in the defense of any claims or actions that may be made by or against the Company that affect Employee\u2019s prior areas of responsibility, except if Employee\u2019s reasonable interests are adverse to the Company in such claim or action. The Company agrees to promptly reimburse Employee for all of Employee\u2019s reasonable travel and other direct expenses incurred, or to be reasonably incurred, to comply with Employee\u2019s obligations under this Paragraph 14, subject to Employee\u2019s submission to the Company of documentation substantiating such reasonable expenses as the Company may require.\n15.\tNon-Admission of Liability. This Agreement is not an admission by Employee or Company of any wrongdoing or liability.\n16.\tNo Future Employment. To the extent not prohibited by applicable state law, Employee agrees that they waive any right to reinstatement or future employment with Company or any of its affiliates following Employee\u2019s separation from Company on the Separation Date.\n17.\tResignation of Offices and Directorships. Employee hereby resigns all directorships and board or committee memberships Employee holds within the Company and/or any other entity as a result of employment with the Company. This resignation will be effective as of the Separation Date or such other date as requested by the Company.\n18.\tArbitration. Except as provided below, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Employee\u2019s employment with, separation from, and/or affiliation with Company, shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Both parties acknowledge that this Agreement and any actions or proceedings pursuant to it are covered and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201CFAA\u201D) and that the parties to the Agreement are subject to the FAA.\nThe only legal disputes and claims not covered by this Agreement are claims: (a) for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, for unemployment benefits, or for other employment-related benefits under a plan or collective bargaining agreement that provides its own process for dispute resolution; (b) for alleged violations of the National Labor Relations Act; (c) constituting sexual harassment or sexual assault disputes as defined by the FAA; (d) for which this Agreement would be invalid or prohibited as a matter of federal law or state or local law that is not preempted by federal law; (e) to enforce this Agreement, compel arbitration, or enforce, modify, or vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award, with such actions to be governed by the FAA; or (f) filed with a federal, state, or local administrative agency such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or National Labor Relations Board.\n19.\tEntire Agreement.
